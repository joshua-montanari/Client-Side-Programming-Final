            You know how a joke can start funny, get annoying, then become funny
            again through sheer attrition? That’s Cuphead’s approach to
            enjoyment. With a beautiful, caustic, near-unceasing stream of boss
            battles, Studio MDHR’s debut made me scream with joy and horror by
            turn, but I settled on joy by the end. The most obvious point to
            begin with is that Cuphead looks astonishing. Its 1930s animation
            style – all watercolour backgrounds and surreal, juddering,
            hand-drawn characters – pay peerless homage to Max Fleischer and his
            ilk, and are perfectly implemented. Somehow it manages to balance
            dozens of moving elements and a slight rear-projection blur without
            ever feeling unreadable in even the most frantic moments. There has
            never been a game that looks like this and there may never be again.
            Every scene is a masterwork – it’s a near-unbelievable achievement
            for an art style.

            The sound work is an ideal match: a huge jumble of high-tempo
            ragtime, swing, big band, and jazz (the list of musicians is almost
            as long as the rest of the credits combined) pummels away
            wonderfully in the background of every fight. It makes Cuphead feel
            truly out of time, and its bizarre mix of ‘30s aesthetics and ‘80s
            design more heady than ever. I also feel duty-bound to point out
            that the way Porkrind the shopkeeper bellows “welcome” made me laugh
            every single time I heard it. There’s no doubt that it’s gorgeous,
            and many people will be drawn to that, but that veneer conceals a
            very niche, hardcore design. You may have gleaned by now that this
            game is really, really hard. It’s absolutely uncompromising in its
            difficulty from the outset. No level includes checkpoints and,
            barring one late-game match-up, there is no way to regain lost
            health. You could hit levels that take hours to beat, and the finale
            is locked off until you beat every other level on “Regular”
            difficulty (i.e. extremely difficult). And don’t think that local
            co-op will ease things up – dropping in a second player as Cuphead’s
            pal Mugman makes events onscreen that much harder to follow. I find
            it actively harder with a second player, if anything.

            Cuphead made me feel more good and more bad than any other game I’ve
            played in the last several years. I swore, laughed, and hollered
            with delight. I hated it (and my own fingers) for long stretches
            but, having finished, I realise that’s more or less the point – I
            emerged from all that pain smiling. Rather than simply offering the
            player what they want, Cuphead makes them earn that right – the
            rewards, if you can hack the tests, are absolutely worth it. Cuphead
            is incredible for more than just its looks. But before you dive in,
            make sure you actually want a game that plays like this, and not
            just a game that looks like this. If you buy something through this
            post, IGN may get a share of the sale. For

            Very few things in life can make me as happy as a great Pokemon RPG,
            and Sword and Shield repeatedly left me in a state of pure,
            child-like joy. The elated surprise of not knowing what’s coming is
            something this series does extremely well if you can manage to play
            it relatively unspoiled (fear not, this review won’t deprive you of
            that), and I’m glad that sense of wonder is still alive and kicking
            in Sword and Shield. With every new game in this 23-year-old series,
            changes big and small are always made, but I’ve never been willing
            to declare the latest entry the new gold standard for Pokemon
            because they’ve consistently been a balance of better and worse. But
            the first mainline game on the Switch has changed that: though there
            is still no “perfect Pokemon game,” the 40-plus hours I’ve spent
            with Sword and Shield have left me comfortable with calling them the
            best Pokemon games I have ever played – and I’ve played ‘em all.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Experiencing the avalanche of improvements made me realize just how
            complacent I’d become with Pokemon mechanics that were, in
            hindsight, less than ideal. While this series has always been great
            about introducing new players with thorough tutorials, it seems
            crazy that experienced players have never been able to skip them
            until now. Just tell the NPC you know what’s up and they’ll get out
            of the way and let you get down to the business of catching and
            training – you can even catch Pokemon without being told how, and
            doing so automatically skips the tutorial. Likewise, travel across
            the map has been made fast and convenient, and even connecting with
            other people is as simple as pressing the Y button. And perhaps most
            overdue of all, Sword and Shield have killed the sacred cow of the
            traditional random encounters that have all too often made exploring
            feel like a slog. All throughout, Sword and Shield feels like it
            respects your time. Sword and Shield manage to fix all of these
            problems while leaving Pokemon’s signature charm not just intact,
            but enhanced by the Switch’s huge graphical leap over the 3DS. I
            never want to go back.

            Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs
            than anything that’s come before. I’d still like better cutscenes,
            companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually
            interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when
            everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they
            respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from
            random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only
            the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling
            wonderful creatures. And hey, if I’m missing any tedious repetition,
            I can always get back into breeding.
